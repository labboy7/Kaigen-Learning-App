# Kaigen Learning App

We haven't decided on a name yet lol

## How to Download

### 1. Turn on Developer Mode
I'm not sure if you actually have to do this... but it doesn't negatively affect your phone unless you're downloading risky apps that have viruses...which we all know the very trustworthy crissy would never do ðŸ˜‰
Anyway, it's in settings. Go to the Settings app, and go down to About Phone (it should be at the bottom of the main settings page)

This is where things may deviate depending on what device you are using...
You are looking for something called **Build Number**... Mine is in Software Information

Click it a bunch of times and it will give you a prompt saying you are close to becoming a developer... just keep clicking until it says you are or that developer mode has already been turned on.

You only have to do this step once.

### 2. Download the Program
Once you do that, Download the latest release, which is...

**app-release.apk**

If you see another file, don't download it, only download that specific .apk

Your phone *should* tell you that this file may be malicious or could harm your device, as we have already established, I would never make a malicious program ðŸ˜‰, so go ahead and click you allow it to download.

The file should now be in your files app.

My phone (Samsung) has a specific section of the files app for APK files or "installation files", it would be there, otherwise, check your downloads folder.

Click it, my phone prompted me to allow the files app to install this foreign program, accept that.

**A prompt may open saying that Google Play Protect wants to scan the app for malicious code, accept it.**

I don't think you have to accept the scan, but I just did it to make sure that I didn't secretly try to hack myself ðŸ˜¨.

It should say the app downloaded.

Once you have completed that, the app should go wherever your normal apps go.

**Once you are done with the app, you may delete it.**

## If you would like to see the code I made, go to the **main.dart** file !!!
